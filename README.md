MDtiki
======

This is a fork from the rather well done MDwiki which takes his concept and move it in another direction.

See <https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki/releases> for readily precompiled releases.

See http://www.mdwiki.info for more info and documentation.

## Goals
1. Update the base libraries and gimmiks with modern alternatives.
1. Replace the index.html file with a themeable template.
1. Add a sqlite DB backend.
1. Add user registration.
1. Add yaml metadata.
1. Add yaml types.
1. Add type api.
1. Add Pages administration
1. Add Forms

Basically I want to turn MD Wiki into Yet Another Content Management System.
All using node as a builder and package manager.

So MDWiki to me is a beautiful Concept Because it is so simple.
